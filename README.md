# jetbrains--simple-chatty-bot
(Not so) final code for a project titled Simple Chatty Bot on Hyperskill/JetBrains Academy but hey at least I passed :D

This program is a simple Python program doing several things:
1. Returns your name
2. Guesses your age by using remainders
3. Does a counting from 0 to any number you wish for
4. Gives a simple quiz

To-do:
1. Point(3): Make the quiz run again after inputting wrong answer instead of continuing, I guess I just need a litle syntax here and there
